intro_text: "The permanent exhibition at Territories of Memory follows the path of those deported to Nazi camps. It was very soon realised that their fate was sealed. Guided by the voice of actor Pierre Arditi and the sound, images and lighting effects, visitors tour spaces that explore one of the darkest episodes of our history: the Second World War, the rise of Nazism, and concentration and extermination camps. The trail continues into testimonies, telling stories of survival after captivity. At the end of this intense and moving tour, each visitor is confronted with current reality and will ask themselves: what can we do and how do we resist today?"

          text: "Throughout history, there have always been executioners and victims, witnesses and people offering resistance... all of them human beings. Nevertheless, these concepts are not set in stone: they intermingle and evolve in a nuanced way. This section asks the visitor this question: what are the leveraging factors that lead us, as citizens, to resist what outrages us?"

        These teaching documents enable education providers to prepare for a visit to Territories of Memory by approaching the elements that are vital for understanding the exhibition “Never again! A journey through the Nazi camps to consider resistance today.”

        This tour marks the beginning of Remembrance work that could very well continue... To that end, further resources are available, for instance via the [George Orwell Library](/bibliotheque-et-librairie) or the [Stéphane Hessel bookshop](/bibliotheque-et-librairie).
