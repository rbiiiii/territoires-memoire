Almost all countries in Europe are facing the rise of extreme right parties and movements, and if some of them face these phenomena for decades, each national context is specific. Some countries only know radical, Neo-Nazi, and violent movements at the margins, some face well organized political parties at the gateway of the power, and others have known them at local or national government for years.

In some countries, political parties are clearly labeled at the extreme right with discourses blending nationalism, racism and social Darwinism. In others, political parties mobilize a populist rhetoric opposing a glorious people against corrupted elite with, sometimes, a rejection of others. Often, the fear of Islam, Afrophobia, and the rejection of the consolidated Europe are central topics.

Within this galaxy, concepts are multiple and any of them fit with all the national contexts in a comparative perspective. At the same time, these groups and political parties change their rhetoric, their programme or their behavior to access power or to influence public opinion.

The International Experts Workshop seeks to offer a country-by-country tour of Europe of extreme right parties and movements, and negative effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms, and explore responses to these phenomenons. It is organised by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the « Centre d’Etudes Démocratie » (Faculté de Droit de Science politique et de Criminologie de l’Université de Liège). The working languages are French and English.
